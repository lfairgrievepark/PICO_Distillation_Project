This is script to analyze images of lithium being compressed. Basically, the mechanical properties of lithium are of interest when attempting to design lithium batteries. A custom built apparatus allowed for images of lithium disks to be imaged as a force is applied. These scripts take the images and attempt to quantify the area of the lithium disk.

There are two unique different data sets here taken under similar conditions

Lithium_Counter.py: Cuts, isolates and colours in the "lithium" disk in the image, saving as a new image. Exports the area of the lithium disk

Lithium_Plotter.py: Plots the lithium area data

Gif_Maker.py: Creates a gif out of the generated lithium area images
